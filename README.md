# ZotCourt
Full-stack IoT Application HackUCI 2021

## Inspiration
After spending hours on the court practicing my basketball skills, I wanted to put them to the test. 

Hey, wanna play a game of pick up in a few? 

I would typically ask my friend. 

Sure

They would respond.

But what about those days 
when you are excited to try those new skills 
but everyone around is busy?

The next best thing is hoping a player is already playing on the court.
Getting a chance to ask them for a game. 

**A game begins. A competition ensues. A Friendship is born.**
 
## What it does
ZotCourt+ uses vibration sensing technology to detect ball activity on the basketball court, providing this information to players via a website that updates its status frequently, providing those who may be interested in a round of pick up with others.
 
## How we built it
We had three modules. 

**The raspberry pi, the server, and the client web page.***

-Using a Raspberry pi and SW-420, we were able to detect vibrations at high sensitivity built using a python script. 

- **[enter info for server]**

- **[enter info for client web page]**

## Challenges we ran into
- Working under remote conditions was challenging due to the physical constraints we faced, but luckily we were able to control versions of our system via **GitHub**. 

- Communication at a time fell short because we all trying to balance our HackUCI project and our school projects. 

- I (Andre) could have used my time better. Instead of spending time focusing on building the model, I could have jumped onto the server or client-side code. As a result, it placed a lot of pressure on my other teammates. *lesson learned*

- Trying to accomplish the logic for the detection system was challenging when it came to no activity coming out of the pi. Accounting for this took many hours. Along with some of the post request info. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building a minimum viable product that displayed the basic functionality of the system

- Each of us learning at least one thing every step of the way. Whether this was about our project or about ourselves and our teammates. 

- Learning how to send a pull request on git hub and using git actively on the command-line interface (CLI) was very impactful for the project and for our futures.

- Working on a repository collaboratively for the first time!

- Understanding how GET and POST requests work

## What we learned
- We learned that our friendship and our sanity are more important in the long run. Giving each team member space and trusting one another makes for a pleasurable experience.

- Never underestimate the amount of time it takes to establish a back-end server connection.

## What's next for ZotCourt+
ZotCourt+ technology can be seen on restaurant dining tables to speed up turnaround time for seating tables. Usually, people who dine in at a restaurant spend an avg of 45 minutes to an hour at a table. A discrepancy occurs however when the customers are done eating, walk away from the table, and leave the restaurant. At that point, the server sees the visual cue (dirty and vacant tables). Has the table cleaned up,  walks to the host stand to tell the host/hostess that the table is now empty and ready for use. If the server does not update the host, they will avoid seating the table assuming the table is still being used. **Without ZotCourt+ technology**, the discrepancy **creates longer wait times at the restaurant, fewer tips in the pockets of the restaurant workers, and angry/impatient customers**...
